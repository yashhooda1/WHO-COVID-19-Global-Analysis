# WHO-COVID-19-Global-Analysis
🌍 WHO COVID-19 Global Analysis 📌 Project Description This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). It combines daily reported cases and deaths with global vaccination data to explore the pandemic's progression and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.  📊 Dataset Overview COVID-19 Cases/Deaths: Source: WHO Includes daily reported cases and deaths by country and WHO region.  Vaccination Data: Source: WHO Includes total vaccinations, people vaccinated (1+ dose), booster doses, and per-capita vaccination rates.  🧪 Analysis Objectives Track and visualize global COVID-19 case and death trends.  Compare regional and country-level pandemic impacts.  Assess the impact of vaccination on cases and mortality rates.  Forecast future cases and deaths using ARIMA time-series modeling.  🔍 Key Findings 📈 Global Peaks:  Cases peaked on Dec 25, 2022 with over 44 million new cases in one day.  Deaths peaked on Jan 24, 2021 with over 103,000 deaths reported.  💉 Vaccination Impact:  Deaths significantly declined following mass vaccine rollouts.  Booster doses contributed to sustained protection, especially in high-risk populations.  📉 Forecasting with ARIMA:  Predictive modeling indicates a gradual decline in deaths and fluctuating trends in new cases.  Unpredictable spikes may occur due to variants or social/policy factors.  📦 Technologies Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)  Jupyter Notebook  WHO Public Datasets  📁 Files WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv: Raw COVID-19 case/death data.  vaccination-data.csv: Global vaccination metrics.
